# CustomQuest
Modular turn-based-RPG-like battle simulator with JSON configuration files.

## Description  
**CustomQuest** is a simple game that lets you battle aganist monsters with a simple RPG-like turn-based mechanic. 

But it's not just that!  
**CustomQuest** is _modular_, meaning _you_ can create your **characters**, your **enemies**, your **items** and your **movesets** via JSON files.  

Personalize your game with your custom profiles and try out different strategy, all in your terminal!

## Credits & Dependencies

### JSON for Modern C++
To work easly with JSON files, **CustomQuest** relies on [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) by [Niels Lohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann).   
Although relying on external libraries, no dependencies are needed to install **CustomQuest**, since said library is already included in this repository (``src/include/json.hpp``) via the [single_include](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp) version provided by the author, in order to make it easier for you, the end user, to enjoy **CustomQuest**.
